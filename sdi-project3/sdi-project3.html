<p>I chose to use samurai for my theme this time. I was going to do samurai and ninja but as we could not use ninja I stuck with samurai. Samurai are of interest to me and have been for years.</p>
<p>I had alot of trouble with some thing and am not sure if I got everything or not. I do know that what I do have is working properly after some effort on some of it.</p>
